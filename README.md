Fire Cutter is a responsive fullstack e-commerce application designed to offer a smooth and engaging shopping experience. The project combines a powerful CMS Wix Headless Studio backend with a modern frontend stack, including Next.js, to deliver a dynamic and high-performing online store.

Key technologies and features include:

State Management: I utilized Zustand for effective state management, ensuring that the shopping cart, user preferences, and other dynamic elements remain responsive and consistent across the application.

#Client-Side Utilities: js-cookie was used to handle client-side cookies, enabling features like session persistence, personalized experiences, and user-specific settings.

User Feedback: I integrated react-hot-toast for real-time notifications, providing instant feedback on actions like adding items to the cart. Additionally, react-confetti adds a celebratory touch to key moments, enhancing the user experience.

Styling: The application was styled with HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS, resulting in a clean, modern, and fully responsive design that looks great on any device.

"Fire Cutter" demonstrates my ability to develop a comprehensive e-commerce platform by combining a headless CMS with a robust frontend, ensuring both functionality and an enjoyable user experience.
